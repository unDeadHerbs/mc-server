Mine-Craft Server
=================

This project is an attempt to make revisioning of the Minecraft server I manage easier to do.

Branches
--------
- running
  The version activity running on the server.
- next
  The version the server will be running on next restart.
- dev
  The branch used for testing and development.
- worlds
  A backup of the world files for safety.
- plugins
  Separated the plugins as they may be revision-ed more carefully later.


TODO list
---------
- have worlds sim-linked to folder
- make a script to auto sim-link worlds to folder
- have server auto restart on shutdown
- have mechanism to not restart server from mc admin
